# E-Commerce Website with Authentication

## üéâ What's New

I've successfully integrated your SheetDB API and added login/register functionality to your React e-commerce website!

### ‚úÖ New Features Added:

1. **Login Page** (`/login`) - Beautiful, responsive login form
2. **Register Page** (`/register`) - User registration with validation
3. **Authentication Context** - Manages user sessions with localStorage
4. **Updated Navigation** - Shows login/logout status and user welcome message
5. **API Integration** - Connected to your SheetDB API: `https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/v58gh3olczv6i`

### üîß Technical Changes Made:

#### 1. New Files Created:
- `src/Login.js` - Login page component
- `src/Register.js` - Register page component  
- `src/context/auth_context.js` - Authentication management

#### 2. Files Updated:
- `src/App.js` - Added login/register routes
- `src/index.js` - Wrapped app with AuthProvider
- `src/components/Nav.js` - Updated navigation with auth status
- `src/context/productContext.js` - Updated API URL and data processing
- `src/Reducer/productReducer.js` - Handle string boolean values from API

#### 3. API Data Processing:
Your SheetDB API returns data in string format, so I've added processing to:
- Convert price strings to numbers
- Split comma-separated image URLs into arrays
- Convert string booleans ("TRUE"/"FALSE") to actual booleans
- Process product ratings, reviews, and stock numbers

## üöÄ How to Use

### Starting the Application:
```bash
cd E-Commerce-Website-using-React-Js-main
npm start
```

### Authentication Features:

#### Login:
1. Navigate to `/login` or click "Sign In" in the navigation
2. Enter any email and password (demo purposes)
3. Successfully logged-in users see a welcome message and logout button

#### Register:
1. Navigate to `/register` or click "Create one here" from login page
2. Enter email, password, and confirm password
3. Password validation ensures matching passwords and minimum length
4. Successful registration automatically logs the user in

#### User Session:
- User data is stored in localStorage for persistence
- Users remain logged in across browser sessions
- Logout clears the session data

### Product Display:
- Products load from your SheetDB API automatically
- Featured products (where `featured` = "TRUE") display in the featured section
- Product images, prices, and details show correctly
- Single product pages work with the new API structure

## üîç API Integration Details

Your SheetDB API provides products with this structure:
```json
{
  "id": "product1",
  "name": "Premium Cashews", 
  "featured": "TRUE",
  "company": "HealthyBites",
  "price": "1500",
  "colors": "#ff0000",
  "image": "image1.jpg,image2.jpg,image3.jpg",
  "description": "High-quality premium cashews...",
  "category": "dry fruits",
  "shipping": "TRUE",
  "stock": "8",
  "reviews": "150", 
  "stars": "4.9"
}
```

The application automatically processes this data to work with the existing components.

## üé® UI/UX Features:

### Login/Register Pages:
- Modern gradient background
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Form validation with error messages
- Loading states during authentication
- Clean, professional styling matching your theme

### Navigation:
- Shows "Sign In" button when not logged in
- Displays user welcome message when logged in
- Logout functionality
- Maintains existing cart and navigation features

## üõ† Development Notes:

### Authentication System:
- Uses React Context for state management
- localStorage for session persistence
- Form validation and error handling
- Simulated backend (easily replaceable with real API)

### Data Processing:
- Handles string-to-number conversions
- Splits comma-separated values into arrays
- Maintains compatibility with existing product components

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements):

1. **Backend Integration**: Replace localStorage auth with real backend API
2. **User Profiles**: Add user profile pages and settings
3. **Order History**: Track user purchase history
4. **Email Verification**: Add email verification for registration
5. **Password Reset**: Implement forgot password functionality
6. **Social Login**: Add Google/Facebook login options

## üìù Testing:

### To Test Authentication:
1. Go to `/register` and create an account
2. Use any email format (e.g., `test@example.com`)
3. Use any password (minimum 6 characters)
4. Verify you're redirected to home page and see welcome message
5. Test logout functionality
6. Test login with the same credentials

### To Test Product API:
1. Verify products load on the home page
2. Check that featured products display correctly
3. Navigate to `/products` to see the full catalog
4. Click on individual products to test single product pages

Your e-commerce website is now ready with full authentication and your custom product API integration! üéâ
